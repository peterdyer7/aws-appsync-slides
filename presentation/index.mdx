## Bootstrapping applications using
# AWS Amplify
## with
# AWS Appsync

Fullstack development

---

### Who am I

- Peter
- Twenty years working in software
- Majority for small software companies
- Majority as a technical product manager
- Current focus is fullstack development

---

# Backend-as-a-Service / Serverless

- Interactive software ASAP
- Leverage the work of others
- Humans are expensive
- (At scale, things are different) 

---

# My view of Serverless

- Authentication
- Database
- Storage
- Functions
- Hosting
- APIs
- AI / ML
- Etc, etc

---

# AWS Appsync

AWS GraphQL Service

> AWS AppSync is a serverless back-end for mobile, web and enterprise applications

---

# AWS Amplify Framework

- Evolution of AWS Mobile Hub
- Amazon's answer to Google Firebase
- Make it easy for application (front-end) developers to use (consume) back-end resources

> The foundation for your cloud-powered mobile & web apps

---

### Amplify Categories

- Analytics
- API (GraphQL via <strong>AppSync</strong> and REST)
- Authentication
- Functions
- Hosting
- Storage
- Notifications

---

### Using Amplify

1. AWS Account
2. Amplify CLI
3. Docs and libs

---

### Amplify Docs and Libs

- iOS - Swift
- Android - Java
- Web - JavaScript - <strong>React</strong>, Angular, Ionic, Vue
- React Native

---

# Demo

-----

Prereq's
- Amplify CLI installed and configured
- React project created, libraries installed and amplify init

---

### Current State - Local

- amplify/backend folder - current local config
- amplify/#current-cloud-backend folder - last push'ed config
- amplify/.config folder - project settings
- .amplifyrc file - amplify project specific config

---

### Current State - Remote

- 2 new roles (auth and unauth)
- S3 bucket
- Cloudformation Stack

---

### AppSync Integration

1. Setup API endpoint with authentication and schema in client
2. Generate JavaScript (TypeScript) code from schema
3. Write app code to run queries, mutations and subscriptions

---

### Demo

-----

amplify add api

amplify push

---

### Demo

-----

after amplify push completes

---

### Result - Local

- aws-export.js - AWS config (GraphQL endpoint, API key, etc)
- graphql folder - schema and codegen for queries, mutations and subscriptions
- types for Flow or TypeScript

---

### Result - Remote

- AppSync project created
- Lots of other stuff

---

### Demo

-----

write some code

---

### Client Options

+ Amplify GraphQL client
+ AWS AppSync (SDK) / Apollo client

---

### A word about auth

- amplify add auth
- Creates Cognito User and Identiy Pools
- can be integrated with API

---

# Directives

- Part of schema (@)
- @model
- @auth
- @connection
- @searchable
- @versioned

---

export default CodeSlide

```javascript
type Blog @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post] @connection(name: "BlogPosts")
}
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  blog: Blog @connection(name: "BlogPosts")
  comments: [Comment] @connection(name: "PostComments")
}
type Comment @model {
  id: ID!
  content: String
  post: Post @connection(name: "PostComments")
}
```

---

export default CodeSlide

```javascript
type PrivateNote
  @model
  @auth(rules: [{allow: owner}])
{
  id: ID!
  content: String!
}
```

---

export default CodeSlide

```javascript
type Task 
  @model 
  @auth(rules: [
      {allow: groups, groups: ["Managers"], queries: null, mutations: [create, update, delete]},
      {allow: groups, groups: ["Employees"], queries: [get, list], mutations: null}
    ])
{
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  status: String
}
```

# AppSync

### Architecture

<Image src={systemoverview} />
<Text textSize="16px">Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/system-overview-and-architecture.html</Text>

---

## How it works

- Resolvers "translate" GraphQL to do something with a "Data Source"
- Data Sources = DynamoDB, Lambda, ElasticSearch, Aurora, HTTP
- Translation via VTL (Apache Velocity Template Language)

---

### Demo

-----

AWS Console - AppSync

---

### Takeaways

- Teams may struggle with Amplify
- Be ready to edit .gitignore
- Client side codegen is probably not that valuable
- Amplify/Appsync - ownership matters
- If you just want GraphQL API - donâ€™t start with Amplify 

---

### Trade-off

- Serverless - Quick to Production
- vs
- Traditional - Control


- Prototyping?
